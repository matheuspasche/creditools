\title{Define a Simulation Stage}
\usage{
new_credit_policy_stage(name, type, ...)

stage_cutoff(name, cutoffs, observed_outcome_col = NULL)

stage_rate(
  name,
  base_rate,
  observed_outcome_col = NULL,
  stress_by_score = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{A character string for the name of the stage (e.g., "credit", "fraud", "conversion").}

\item{...}{Specific parameters for the stage type.}

\item{cutoffs}{A named list where names are score columns and values are
the cutoffs to be applied.}

\item{observed_outcome_col}{The column in the original data that contains the
observed outcome for this stage (0 or 1), if it exists.}

\item{base_rate}{The base rate for the simulation (e.g., 0.4 for a 40\% conversion rate).}

\item{stress_by_score}{An optional named list to stress the \code{base_rate} based on a
score's value. Uses a monotonic increase assumption. See \code{stress_monotonic_increase()}.}
}
\value{
A \code{credit_policy_stage} object.
}
\description{
These functions create definitions for different types of stages in a
credit policy simulation funnel.

\code{stage_cutoff()} defines a stage where approval is determined by one or more
score cutoffs. An applicant passes if their score is >= the cutoff for all
defined scores in this stage.

\code{stage_rate()} defines a stage where "approval" (e.g., conversion, acceptance)
is determined by a simulated rate. This is useful for stages that are not
score-based.

\examples{
# Defines a stage that requires a 'new_score' of at least 650
credit_stage <- stage_cutoff(name = "credit_check", cutoffs = list(new_score = 650))
# Defines a stage with a 95\% pass rate (e.g., for fraud checks)
fraud_stage <- stage_rate(name = "fraud_check", base_rate = 0.95)

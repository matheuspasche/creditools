\title{Calculate the trade-off elasticity between approval and default rates}
\usage{
calculate_tradeoff_elasticity(tradeoff_data, elasticity_threshold = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{tradeoff_data}{Data frame with approval and default rates}

\item{elasticity_threshold}{Threshold for significant elasticity}
}
\value{
Data frame with elasticity calculations
}
\description{
This function measures how much the default rate changes relative to
changes in the approval rate, helping identify where small increases
in approval lead to large increases in default.

\title{Find optimal cutoffs for a credit policy stage}
\usage{
find_optimal_cutoffs(
  data,
  config,
  cutoff_steps = 10,
  target_default_rate = 0.05,
  min_approval_rate = 0.3,
  parallel = FALSE,
  n_cores = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing applicant data.}

\item{config}{A base \code{credit_policy} object. The optimization will add a
\code{stage_cutoff} to this policy for each iteration.}

\item{cutoff_steps}{The number of steps to create for each score's cutoff range.
The range is from the min to the max score in the data.}

\item{target_default_rate}{The maximum acceptable overall default rate for the approved population.}

\item{min_approval_rate}{The minimum acceptable overall approval rate.}

\item{parallel}{A logical flag indicating whether to use parallel processing.
Requires the \code{future} and \code{furrr} packages.}

\item{n_cores}{The number of cores to use for parallel processing. Defaults to
all available cores minus one.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the single best combination of cutoffs found, along
with its performance metrics. The full evaluation results are available in
the \code{evaluation_results} attribute of the returned object.
}
\description{
This function systematically evaluates a grid of cutoff combinations for a set
of scores to find the optimal set of cutoffs that maximizes a trade-off
score while respecting given constraints on default and approval rates.
}
\details{
The optimization works by modifying a base \code{credit_policy} object. For each
combination of cutoffs, it creates a new \code{stage_cutoff} and inserts it as the
first stage of the simulation funnel. It then runs the full multi-stage
simulation and evaluates the final metrics.

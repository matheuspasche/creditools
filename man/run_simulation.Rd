\usage{
run_simulation(data, policy)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing applicant data. Must include columns
specified in the \code{credit_policy} object.}

\item{policy}{A \code{credit_policy} object created by \code{credit_policy()}, with
a list of stages created by \code{stage_cutoff()} or \code{stage_rate()}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the simulation results, including new approval
decisions for each stage, final scenario classification, and simulated defaults.

This is the main entry point for running a multi-stage simulation. It takes
a dataset and a \code{credit_policy} object, then applies the defined sequential
stages in the policy to simulate new approval decisions and their outcomes.

Description: Provides a comprehensive suite of tools for forward-looking credit
    risk analysis and policy simulation. The core purpose of 'creditools' is to
    empower risk analysts to move beyond traditional back-testing by simulating
    the potential outcomes of new credit strategies. It allows for the creation of
    multi-stage decision funnels (e.g., score cutoffs, fraud checks, conversion rates)
    and models the performance of previously rejected applicants ('swap-ins') under
    these new policies. Key features include simulating defaults for this 'swap-in'
    population under various stress scenarios, running large-scale analyses to map
    the trade-off between approval rates and default rates, and finding optimal
    score cutoffs that align with business constraints. It is an essential toolkit
    for data-driven strategy and optimization in the credit industry.

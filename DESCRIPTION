Description: A toolkit for forward-looking credit risk analysis. 'creditools'
    allows risk analysts to simulate the impact of changing credit policies by
    modeling outcomes for previously rejected applicants ('swap-ins'). It provides
    a framework for defining stress scenarios based on risk aggravation or
    monotonic score-to-risk assumptions, enabling robust estimation of approval
    rates, and potential losses under new cutoff strategies. The package also
    includes functions to analyze the trade-offs and optimize score cutoffs
    to find the efficient frontier between business and risk metrics.
